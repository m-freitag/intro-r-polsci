# Data Viz Challenge

Since data visualization is about creativity and just trying things out,
we will take a different approach in this problem set. 

Together with your group you will work on the [WhoGov](https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/whogov-dataset/) data set. 
It provides information on governing elites. 

1. **Everyone on her/his own (5min):** Skim the [codebook](https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/media/4117/whogov_codebook.pdf)
part **B**. We will **only use the cross-sectional data**.

2. **Together in your group (5min):** Discuss the data and agree on something
interesting you want to visualize. 

3. **Everyone on her/his own (30mins):** Implement the visualization you agreed
 upon in R. Tipp: You can use all the links and pointers from the slides or google
 when you are stuck!

4. **Together in your group (10mins):** Share your versions with your group. Pick the best and fine-tune it together. 


Back in the plenum, we will pick a winner!

Criteria:

- Is it a truthful display of the data?
- Is it functional?
- Is it pretty?
- Is it insightful?
