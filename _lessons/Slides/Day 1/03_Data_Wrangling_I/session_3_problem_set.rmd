# Data Wrangling UN Votes

In this problem set, we will use data from the [unvotes](https://github.com/dgrtwo/unvotes)
package. It contains data for all countries voting history in the general assembly.

Here is a description of the data set:

# Task 1

Familiarize yourself with the data. What's each variables type/class?

```{r}

```

What is the level of observation of this data set?

Is this data set tidy?

# Task 2

## a)

With
```{r}
datasummary_skim(unvotes$issue, type = "categorical")
```
you get a quick summary for the categorical issue variable.

However, as each `rcid` occurs multiple times for each country, the issues are,
of course, also repeatedly present in our data.

What we want is a **sorted** table for the distribution of our issue variable 
over all roll calls.

Create such table/tibble/data frame using **only** tidyverse verbs/functions (scroll to the bottom of this document if you need a hint).

```{r}

```

## b) 

Which issue category has the highest share of important votes?

```{r}

```

# Task 3


## a) 

Add variables that show, for each country, the number and share of "yes", "no", and "abstain" votes, 
pooled over all years. Additionally, put out a tibble/data frame with one 
row for each country and these new variables. 

```{r}

```

## b) 

Calculate, for each country and issue, the number and share of "yes" votes but 
only for "important votes" and for the [permanent members](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/current-members) 
of the security council. The output should have 30 rows.

```{r}

```


## c) 

Get the years with the highest and lowest share of "yes" votes for 
each country.


```{r}

```

Task 2a: `distinct()` may be helpful here!
