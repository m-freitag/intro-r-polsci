# Workflow

- Navigate to `Session Scripts > Session 3` and open `Session_3_script.R`.

- You will see a pre-formatted Script.

- The script is otherwise empty. Fill it with the stuff I will discuss on the slides.

- Make comments for yourself. Learn as you write. Explore. Stage, commit and push.

- Hopefully not you &rightarrow; <img src= "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cangiuli/img/angry.gif" ALIGN=”right”>

- If you have a second monitor, great! If not, split your screen.

---

# Tidyverse Packages

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width= "45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/tidyverse.png")
```

- These are only the tidyverse packages loaded by default. There are 
[more](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/) (e.g. [lubridate](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate)).

---

# The Philosophy: Tidy Data

> 1. Each variable forms a column.
> 2. Each observation forms a row.
> 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table. [(Wickham 2014)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf)

- Sounds pretty reasonable. 3. is related to constructing clean relational data 
bases (we will see an example later).

- However, we can relax this from time to time given our needs/statistical methods.

.hl2[Messy data] is everything else, e.g.:

.code60[
```{r, echo = FALSE}

lotr <- data.frame(
  race = c("hobbits", "hobbits", "elves", "hobbits", "dwarves", "men"),
  character = c("Frodo", "Sam", "Arwen", "Golum", "Gimli", "Eowyn"),
  gender = c("male", "male", "female", "male", "male", "female"),
  `age_0-100` = c(1,1,0,0,0,1),
  `age_100-500` = c(0,0,0,0,1,0),
  `age_500-100` = c(0,0,0,1,0,0),
  `age_>1000` = c(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0), 
  check.names = FALSE
)
lotr

```
]
---
# The Philosophy: Tidy Data

Tidy:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

lotr <- lotr %>%
  pivot_longer(4:7, names_to = "age_cat", values_to = "classifier") %>%
  filter(classifier == 1) %>%
  select(-classifier) %>%
  mutate(age_cat = str_remove(age_cat, "age_"))

as.data.frame(lotr)

```

---

# Tibbles

- Tibbles are data.frames but with some perks. For instance, subset more strictly.

- They also print differently (better):

```{r}
as_tibble(lotr) # You don't have the data here.
# Hint: You can create one just like data frames but with tibble().
```

---

# Importing/Exporting Data

- R comes with it's own two file formats, `.rds` (single objects) and `.rda` (multiple
    objects/tabular data).

- However, for saving the latter you will (and should) use `.csv` or `.json` (human readable) most of the time.

--
  
- For R novices, importing and exporting can be a bit of a pain.

    - There are different functions/packages for reading different file formats (haven, data.table, readxl etc.).

- Thankfully, the [rio](https://github.com/leeper/rio) package by Thomas Leeper and Chung-hong Chan et al. makes our life easier.

- Provides `export()` and `import` as wrappers fot the above mentioned packages.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rio")
``` 

---

# Importing/Exporting Data

```{r, eval = FALSE, resu}
library(rio)
# Export
export(mtcars, "mtcars.csv") # R's built-in mtcars data-set.
export(mtcars, "mtcars.rds") # R serialized
export(mtcars, "mtcars.dta") # Stata
export(mtcars, "mtcars.json")

# Import
W <- import("mtcars.csv")
X <- import("mtcars.rds")
Y <- import("mtcars.dta")
Z <- import("mtcars.json")

```
---

# Importing/Exporting Data

.code70[
```{r}
# Exporting/importing several data frames: export_list()/import_list()

# Make a list of two built-in data sets.
# tibble::lst() automatically names the elements:
df_list <- tibble::lst(mtcars, iris)

export_list(df_list, file = paste0(names(df_list), ".csv"))
# export_file takes a character vector; hence, we build one from the names of our element
# With the paste0() we paste ".csv" to every element of the character vector
# produced by names(df_list).

Z <- import_list(dir(pattern = "csv$"))
# import_file takes achr vector holding file paths/files.
# With dir() we get all names of the files that match a specific pattern (regular expression). 
# In this case, all files that end with csv ($ matches the end of the string).[1]
```
]

.font70[<sup>[1]</sup> .hl[Fine Point:] [Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) were developed in computer
science to specify search patterns/make character matching possible. They are very useful (e.g. for manipulating/cleaning textual data) but pretty hard to memorize. Even if you know the basics, you will google alot.
In R, I recommend the [stringi/stringr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/regular-expressions.html) packages.]

---

#  Pipes: %>% and |>

- Pipes are crucial to the tidyverse workflow but also in general.

- They make code more readable.

Idea: Take the output of a function and to pass it **as the 
first argument** of another function.

$$f(g(x)) \quad \text{becomes (in R)} \quad x  \quad \text{%>%}^{[2]} \quad g() \quad 
\text{%>%} \quad f()$$

--

.code80[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)

sqrt(mean(x))

x %>%
  mean() %>%
  sqrt()

```
]

.font70[<sup>[2]</sup> .hl[TIPP:] Press ctrl-shift-m to produce the [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) pipe, `%>%`, in RStudio.]

---

# Pipes: %>% and |>

- We can also pass the output as the second, third, ... argument using `.` as a 
placeholder.

- `f(a, b = c)` can be written as `c %>% f(a, b = .)`

Example:

```{r}
"Ceci n&#37;est pas une pipe" %>% gsub("&#37;", "'", .) # gsub() performs replacement of all matches in a chr. vector.
```
--

- They are so useful, the R core team even introduced a base pipe (`|>`), in May 2021.
Something like this happen **very** rarely: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x |>
  mean() |>
  sqrt()
```
---

# Pipes: %>% and |>

- The base pipe is a [tiny](https://statistik-dresden.de/archives/17227) bit faster.

- Does not need an extra dependency. Useful for package development (using the 
magrittr pipe in packages can be annoying sometimes).

--

- .hl[BUT]: it does not (yet) properly support the `.` placeholder (as of June 2021).

We can hack it tho:
```{r}
Sys.setenv("_R_USE_PIPEBIND_" = "true")
"Ceci n&#37;est pas une pipe" |> . => gsub("&#37;", "'", .)
```

- That's pretty ugly and [apparently](https://twitter.com/rdataberlin/status/1396170545046097928) 
still buggy. We will stick to  `%>%`.

# The Data

- We will use the [parlgov](http://www.parlgov.org/) database:

> ParlGov is a data infrastructure for political 
science and contains information for all EU 
and most OECD democracies (37 countries). 
The database combines approximately 1700 
parties, 1000 elections (9400 results), and 1600 cabinets (3900 parties).

- It's relational, i.e. consists of different tables (parties, elections, cabinets)
that can be **joined** using key variables. It can also be joined with the 
[partyfacts](https://partyfacts.herokuapp.com/) dataset that provides id's for 
many other datasets (e.g. CLEA, ESS). 

---

# The Data

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width= "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/relational.svg")
```

- It makes for pretty simple examples and hence we use it.

Let's import the election data:

```{r}
parlgov_elec <- import("http://www.parlgov.org/static/data/development-cp1252/view_election.csv")
```

---

# The Data: Getting an Overview

.code70[
```{r}
glimpse(parlgov_elec) # enhanced version of str()
```
]

---
  
# The Data: Getting an Overview


```{r, echo = FALSE}

datatable(head(parlgov_elec, 10),
  width = "100%",
  options = list(pageLength = 3, scrollX = TRUE)
)
```

.hl[Q]: Is this data set tidy?

---

# The Data: Getting an Overview

.code70[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
datasummary_skim(parlgov_elec) # from modelsummary package. Set type = "categorical" for character vars.

# Of course, not super informative in our hierarchical data set:
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
datasummary_skim(parlgov_elec) %>% kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 17)
```

]

.font70[.hl[TIPP:] The [collapse](https://github.com/SebKrantz/collapse) package 
also provides some data summary functions (`descr()` and `qsu()`) that work really
well on huge data sets. Stata users will love it as its similar to summarize.]

# Tidyverse's Wrangling "Wunderkind": dplyr


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width= "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/raw/master/rstats-artwork/dplyr_wrangling.png")
```
<center> .font70[&copy; [Alison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)] <center/>

A full list of `dplyr` functions can be found [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html).

---

# Data Masking

- Before we jump right in, remember when we talked about R environments in the last
session?

- When we wanted to pass a variable of a data frame (or element of a list) 
to a function, we needed to make that .hl[explicit], e.g., using `$` for subsetting.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lm(df$y ~ df$x)
```

- Some important dplyr functions use [data masking](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html)
such that you can refer to variables just like objects in the (global) envornment.

- Get's rid of .hl[$]s. 

---

# Filtering Rows

- Let's start with something very basic: filtering rows.

- For instance, we might want to obtain only the results of all Bundestag elections:
.code70[
```{r}
parlgov_elec_de <- parlgov_elec %>% # add, e.g., _de if we want to keep our original df 
  filter(country_name_short == "DEU")
```
]
--

- Now, say we want the mean SPD vote share across all bundestag elections (bit silly but alas):

.code60[
```{r, eval = FALSE}

datasummary_skim(parlgov_elec_de$election_type, type = "categorical")

parlgov_elec_de %>% # add, e.g., _de if we want to keep our original df 
  filter(party_name_short == "SPD", election_type == "parliament") %>% 
  mean(vote_share)
```
]

- That does not work....hl[Q]: Why?

.font70[.hl[Note] that using convenience wrappers such as `datasummary()` are no substitute
for learning the underlying base, tidyverse or data.table-way of achieving this.]
---

# summarise() and pull()

- Base-R's summary stats functions can't take a df or tibble and we did not wrap it into 
a dplyr function (.hl[in order for data masking to kick in]).

Two options:

.pull-left[

1\. We can use `pull()` to pull out a vector form a df; works like `$` but for pipes.

```{r}

parlgov_elec_de %>% # add, e.g., _de if we want to keep our original df
  filter(party_name_short == "SPD", election_type == "parliament") %>%
  pull(vote_share) %>% 
  mean()

```
]

--

.pull-right[
2\. We can wrap `mean()`into `summarise()` ("data-masking" for built-in summary functions):

```{r}
parlgov_elec_de %>%
  filter(party_name_short == "SPD", election_type == "parliament") %>%
  summarise(mean(vote_share)) # summarise() takes summary functions such as mean(), sd(), etc.
```
]

---

# summarise()

- Puts out a tibble we can pass to other dplyr functions.
    
- We can also compute more summary statistics with `summarise()` .hl[AND] also turn
them into variables:

```{r}
parlgov_elec_de %>%
  filter(party_name_short == "SPD", election_type == "parliament") %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(vote_share), sd = sd(vote_share), n = n())

# Aside: you can also get the number of rows (in a group) by usining the base 
# function nrow(.) with a placeholder in the above pipe.

```

- In that, it is somewhat similar to the `mutate()` command... but it .hl2[collapses the data].


---
  
# mutate()

- With `mutate()` you can add columns - or overwrite existing ones 
(with the same name) - based on transformations of other variables

- For instance, say we want to add a new column "year" based on the election date 
variable:

```{r}

parlgov_elec_de <- parlgov_elec_de %>% # here, we "overwrite" our df
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(election_date))

```
--

- Here, we used the `year()` function of the [lubridate](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/lubridate.pdf)
package.

- We pulled out an integer vector indicating the election year from the `date` variable
and assigned it to a new variable.<sup>[3]<sup/> 

- `transmute()` is the opposite of `mutate()`; i.e. adds a new variable and drops the rest.

.font70[ <sup>[3]<sup/>] .font70[.hl[NOTE] We will use some core `lubridate` functions on the fly as they are rather intuitive. If you deal with dates often, give [this](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) intro a read.]

---

# select() and arrange()

- Another basic wrangling operation we occasionally need to do do is selecting columns.

- And sometimes we also want to sort columns:

.code70[
```{r}

parlgov_elec_de %>%
  filter(year == 2017) %>%
  select(party_name_short, vote_share, left_right) %>% 
  arrange(desc(left_right)) #default is ascending; we can wrap the masked vector with desc() to sort descending

```
]
---
  
# group_by()


- The last of the most fundamental dplyr "verbs" we will learn is `group_by`.

- Given the variables you supply, it converts a data frame into a grouped version of it such that you can do 
transformations, call functions, manipulate variables, etc. 

- For instance, let's use the whole data to get the the party with the most 
votes ever in a parliamentary election by country...


---
  
# group_by()

.code60[
```{r}
parlgov_elec %>%
  filter(election_type == "parliament") %>% 
  group_by(country_name_short) %>%
  summarise(share_max = max(vote_share, na.rm = T), 
            party = party_name_english[1],
            election_date = election_date[1]
            ) %>%  # note the "collapsing" I mentioned earlier
  arrange(desc(share_max))

```
]
---

# group_by()

- Too complex?

- Ok, let's do something more simple and add a variable that tells us the 
maximum number of total seats for each country.

--


```{r}
parlgov_elec <- parlgov_elec %>%
  group_by(country_id) %>% 
  mutate(max_seats = max(seats_total)) %>% 
  ungroup() # to remove the grouping

```

---

# group_by()

.code70[
```{r}
parlgov_elec %>%
  filter(seats_total == max_seats) %>%
  select(country_name_short, election_date, max_seats) %>%
  distinct() # select distinct rows
```
]
---

# Other usefull stuff

- `tidyr::separate()` to separate entries in columns; `tidyr::unite` to unite columns

- `dplyr::rename()` to rename variables.

- `dplyr::count()` count unique values of one or multiple variables.

- `dplyr::distinct()` or Base R `unique()` to remove duplicate rows

- `dplyr::slice()` to get a slice of rows: `parlgov_elec %>% slice(1:5)` to get the 
first 5 rows.

- `dplyr::across()` apply functions to multiple columns.

.font70[.hl[TIPP] Check out the [`modelsummary`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/datasummary.html) functions in more detail for 
easy crosstabs. ALternatively, use [`janitor::tabyl`](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor).]

# Problem Set 2

Click here to open.

class: inverse, center, middle name: intro


# Advanced Wrangling

---

# Dealing with factor variables: `forcats`

- Factor variables are useful; especially for plotting and modelling.

- With `factor_recode` we can easily recode levels:

```{r}
parlgov_elec_de %>%
  mutate(election_type = fct_recode(election_type, # Coerces the type automatically from chr to fct.
    Bundestagswahl = "parliament",
    Europawahl = "ep"
  )) %>%
  count(election_type)

```

- With `fct_recorder` we can reorder factors (will be usefull for plotting
factors).

---

# Complex conditions: `if_else` and `case_when` 

- Often, we also want to manipulate variables by means of complex conditions

- We will go deeper into control flow statements next week, but here is a sneak preview for data wrangling.

- Say we want to create a variable, "family", that puts parties into some party family
based on some arbitrary cutoff of the time-invariant left_right position:

```{r}
parlgov_elec_de <- parlgov_elec_de %>%
  mutate(family = if_else(left_right > 5, "right", "left"))
```

- Vectorised if: `if_else(condition, true, false)`. 

---

# Complex conditions: `if_else` and `case_when` 

- A generalised version of `if_else` is `case_when`.

- This is .hl2[very] useful:

```{r}
parlgov_elec_de <- parlgov_elec_de %>%
  mutate(family = case_when(
    left_right <= 2.5 ~ "left",
    left_right > 2.5 & left_right < 5 ~ "centre-left",
    left_right > 5 & left_right < 7.5 ~ "centre-right",
    left_right >= 7.5 ~ "right"))

```

- two-sided formula: LHS = logical test; RHS = value to assign if the test
is `TRUE`.

- Values that do not fall into any of the conditions become `NA` which can
be prevented by adding `TRUE ~ something` as the last argument.
---
# tidyr: reshaping data

- Reshaping data is one of the key things you need to when cleaning/analysing data.

- [Two functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/data-import.pdf):

  - `tidyr::pivot_wider/longer()` is for reshaping from long (wide) to wide (long).

Two main arguments:

  - `names_*` and `values_*`, where "*" is "to" for `pivot_wider()` and "from" for 
  `pivot_longer()`.

# tidyr: reshaping data

.hl[Example:]

- Say, we want a table of the vote shares of all major parties for each 
post-WW2 parliamentary election.

- Where each row is an election:


```{r}
wide <- parlgov_elec_de %>%
  filter(election_type == "parliament", vote_share >= 5, year(election_date) >= 1945) %>%
  select(election_date, party_name_short, vote_share) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = party_name_short, values_from = vote_share)

```

---

# tidyr: reshaping data

```{r, echo = FALSE}

datatable(wide,
  width = "100%",
  options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX = TRUE)
)
```

---

# tidyr: reshaping data

- We can revert back to long format:

```{r}
long <- wide %>%
  pivot_longer(!election_date, names_to = "party_name_short", values_to = "vote_share") %>%
  filter(is.na(vote_share) == FALSE) # alternatively, simply set values_drop_na to TRUE in pivot_longer().
head(long)
```

# dplyr: joins

- Let's come back to the relational nature of our data...

---

# The Data

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width= "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/relational.svg")
```

---
  
# dplyr: joins

- Let's come back to the [relational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) nature of our data...

- Remember, they consist of different tables, each representing one "entity type" 
(c.f. the 3rd. point in Wickham's tidy data framework)

- Each table has a unique key, representing each row. This key variable is used to link/join tables

- Suppose we want to join the party and the election table, how do we do that?

---
  
# dplyr: joins

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width= "35%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/joins.png")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width= "35%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/fjoins.png")
```

.hl2[Q] Which join do we need?

---
  
# dplyr: joins

We want a left join here...

.code70[
```{r}
parlgov_party <- rio::import("http://www.parlgov.org/static/data/development-utf-8/view_party.csv")

l_joined <- left_join(parlgov_elec_de, parlgov_party, by = "party_id")

head(l_joined)
```
]

.hl[Q] Why do we get `party_name_short.x` etc?

---

# dplyr: joins

- There are multiple matching (by name) variables in both tables.

- Hence, we need to specify all keys, or let `dplyr` do its magic: 

.code70[
```{r}
l_joined <- left_join(parlgov_elec_de, parlgov_party)

head(l_joined)
```
]

.font70[.hl[NOTE] Be careful if variables are named the same but measure different things.]

# Alternative approaches

- For every tidyverse function ("verb"), there is, of course, a base
R way to do it.

- There are alternatives.

- For instance, the [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) 
and [collapse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebKrantz/cheatsheets/master/collapse.pdf) (also comes with fast versions of summary stats and models) package provide great
and fast data wrangling alternatives.

- Data.table syntax is closer to the base R way of indexing/manipulating data frames.
Some like that.

- Don't be dogmatic. Use whatever suits you and your context. Mix stuff.

- You can find a great comparison of `data.table` and `dplyr` [here](https://atrebas.github.io/post/2019-03-03-datatable-dplyr/).

# A glimpse at `data.table`

- Comes with its own interpretation of data frames, "data tables". Special structure to work faster.

- Looks similar to basic `df[]` indexing but with alot of twists.

- Three elements:  which observations/rows COMMA transformations or other functions COMMA grouping.

Rough `dplyr` equivalent:

<center> DT[.hl[`slice(); filter(); arrange()`], .hl2[`select(); mutate()`], `group_by()`] <center/>

---

# A glimpse at `data.table`

Example:

.pull-left[
```{r}
parlgov_elec_de %>% # add, e.g., _de if we want to keep our original df
  filter(party_name_short == "SPD") %>%
  summarise(mean(vote_share, na.rm = T))
  
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
setDT(parlgov_elec_de)

parlgov_elec_de[party_name_short == "SPD", mean(vote_share, na.rm = T)]
  
```
]

- This last problem set may take a bit longer

- Try to get as far as you can in the remaining time and finish
the rest at home (if you want)
