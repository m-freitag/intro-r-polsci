# Why R?

At the present day (and surely years to come), R is arguably the best programming language for academics:

- R is from statisticians for statisticians.

- Most active (academic) development community for **statistical** computing/programming.

- Nice IDEs; Good integration of other languages and workflow components.

- Best for data viz.

# Showcase

- U can easily combine R code and text in so called Rmarkdown files to produce 
reproducible documents in various output formats (html, pdf, etc.).

- This presentation is a (hopefully good) example. You can check out the source code 
[here](). Feel free to take and adapt. 

- We will learn a little more about this in just a few slides and much more tomorrow!

# Installation

Steps you should have done already:

1.  Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

2.  Install [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

3.  Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Take some care with the user-name if you want to keep this account throughout your career. You can't change it afterwards.

4.  Install and set up [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (and optionally a desktop client).


---

# R-Studio

R-Studio is an IDE (integrated development environment) for the R language:

- comes with a console, code editor, tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace

- open source

- pretty accessible/easy to use

Alternatives:

- Visual Studio Code (nice, if you work with multiple langs; my fav IDE)

- Alternatives are worse for package development, shiny platforms and some other R-specific stuff 
- If your main language is R, RStudio is best

# A Small Detour: Two Types of "Scripts"

In this course, we will use two types of scripts to write our code:

1. Classic R-Scripts (`.R`): simple text file; comments are usually done like so: `# A comment.`

2. [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) files (`.rmd`): combines code and free text (+ figures and formulae)

  - Can be "knitted" to, e.g., .pdf, .html and Word
  
  - Makes your documents (e.g. a paper or a thesis) fully reproducible (more on this tomorrow!)
  
  - Nice for problem sets (hence, we will use it for this right from the beginning)
  
  
---

# Rmarkdown

An Rmarkdown file consists of mainly three things:

1. **YAML header** (Yet Another Markdown Language). Specifies meta info (e.g. author, date, document format, etc.):

```{yaml, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Untitled"
author: Markus
output: html_document
---

```

2\. **Code chunks** sorrounded by ` ``` `. You can execute each chunk individually. 

3\. Plain text formatted via Markdown, a markup language with very [easy syntax](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf).

Problem sets will come as pre-formatted `.rmd` files such that you can start working on excercises directly. 

---

# R projects

- To keep our sanity when coding (and to produce something reproducible in the end), we want to keep all our data, analysis scripts, outputs (e.g. figures) etc. together.

**Three approaches:**

**<span style="color: red;">Bad</span>**

> Creating a folder in the explorer and dropping all files into it. Setting the working directory in the R script manually using, e.g., `setwd("C:/Users/XYZ/New Folder")`.

Just don't use `setwd()`. Ever.<sup>1</sup>

Why? Reproducibility.

.footnote[[1] Yes, I am looking at you, Stata user, who loves to set working directories via `cd`.]

---

# R projects


**<span style="color: #eaaf0e;">Ok</span>**

> Clicking ![](Figs/rproj.png?display=inline-block), creating a local "R-Project".

This creates a folder with an `.Rproj` file. Whenever you open an R-project, a fresh instance of R starts and **the current working directory is set to the project directory.** You can then work with file paths relative to the project directory: E.g. `Figures/somepicture.png")`.


**<span style="color: #03bc0d;">Good</span>**

> Creating a project and using version control.

This is where Git(Hub) comes in...


---

# Why Git(Hub)?

Having multiple scripts inside your project called, e.g., `thesis_analysis_final_01_revised_2.R` is a nightmare.

- Using Git(Hub) improves your workflow:

    - helps with keeping track of the changes you do. 
    - makes (code) collaboration with other researchers easy. 
    - helps to make your research/code projects accessible/reproducible/open source.  

---

# Why Git(Hub)?

What's that thing called "Git"?

- It's a version control system:

$$ \text{Git} \approx \text{MsOffice track changes and restore features} + \text{dropbox/google drive version history}$$
- But it's better, especially for any kind of projects that involve code

- You have to "commit" (i.e. save) actively, but that's a good thing (you could still have some sort of auto-save on you local machine)!


---

# Why Git(Hub)?

<div align="center">
<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png" height=500>
</div>

---

# GitHub

GitHub to the rescue:

- Built on top of Git

- A kind of online cloud service that makes working with Git easier

- again, no automated sync (but that's good!)

- Instead of some folder, your project lives in a remote **repository**

--

.hl[The remote repository is your upstream storage.]

&#x2192; You can **clone** it from GitHub to create a local copy.

&#x2192; You can **fork** some repo (including those of other users); i.e. create a copy of the repo under "your repositories". You can then **clone** this forked repo to get a local copy.

---

# Your first repo

1. Click [here](https://github.com/new) and create a new Git(Hub) repo. Call it "test", set it to .hl[private] and initialize with a readme file.

2. In R-Studio, navigate to `File > New Project > Version Control > Git`.

3. Paste the Repository URL, chose a name and project path and **clone** the thing.

4. You will be asked to provide a personal access token. Generate it [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) using some name and check the "repo box".

5. In the files tab, open README.md. Also click on the Git tab.

Do this .hl[now]!

---

# 4 Operations You Need to Know

1. .hl[Stage] ("add")

  - Tells Git which files u want to make changes (edits, deletes, etc.) to in the repo (simplification); in R-Studio this boils down to "selecting" files/changes to files by checking them.

2. .hl[Commit]

  - Git's way to "save" the changes you staged.

3. .hl[Pull] 

  - "downloads" all new changes/new commits from GitHub
  
4. .hl[Push] (to origin)

  - "uploads" all commits to GitHub; to the origin, i.e. your upstream remote repo.

---

# Commit

Make some changes to the `README.md` file, stage, commit and push.

To establish best practice, give your commit a meaningful name:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/git_commit.png")
```

- In general, commit whenever you think you made a meaningful change

- Push a bit less often than you commit

---

# Collaborate with Git(Hub)

- Using version control really comes to shine when collaborating.

- BUT: you are always collaborating. With your future self. Therefore, always use version control.

- To invite someone to a repo on GitHub, go to the repo `settings > manage access`.

- Your collaborator can then clone the repo and contribute commits, push them etc.


---

# When Things Go Sideways: Merge Conflicts

1. Go to your new repo. Edit the README.md manually in line **3**.

2. Commit some changes in the **same** line locally in R-Studio. Commit.

3. Pull (don't push).

4. Git: 

![:scale 50=%](https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_828080_WeZmP.gif)

---

# When Things Go Sideways: Merge Conflicts

What do you do now?

- Well, you (maybe in exchange with your collaborator) decide!

- Solve the conflict manually, add, commit, push.

---

# Branches

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width= "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/git_tree.png")
```


---

# Branches

- [Branches](https://git-scm.com/book/de/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-auf-einen-Blick) allow you to develop/test some idea without touching the main version of your code.

- Useful for larger projects. You get a full copy of the repo and you can commit/pull/push all you want. 

- If your idea turned out not to work. Just delete the branch.

- In R-Studio, they can be created **via the little purple branch icon in the Git tab**.

- If you want to integrate the feature/idea into the main branch, issue a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (easiest way is via GitHub).


---

# When Things Go Really, Really Wrong

.pull-left[
- DON'T PUSH.

- If you did not, just clone a fresh instance of the repo.

- If you did, you can revert to an older version (but that's more work). 
]

.pull-right[
![:scale 50=%](https://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Family-Guy-Do-Not-Push-Button.gif)

---

# Workflow Summary

1. Create a repo or fork some existing repo

2. Invite collaborators

3. Clone it & create an R project

4. Edit code or make other changes

5. Stage, commit (with message), pull (esp. if u work with others/to avoid conflicts right away), push

6. Rinse and repeat steps 4-5.

---

# Workflow Summary

Yes, the order really is stage, commit, pull, push.

Well, we got an intuition for it when we created a merge conflict. See this concise [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47465841/pull-commit-push-or-commit-pull-push) answer for a summary:

> It's better to commit first. Pulling without commiting may make your work overwritten. With a local commit, conflicts will be shown and prompted for manual merging when pulling, giving you a better control over your work.

---

# Further Steps

- .hl[Fork the course repo and clone it via R-Studio (that's perhaps a bit hacky but easy and does the job).]

- You will need this to conveniently access the course materials/problem sets.

- As the fork is your own copy of the repo, feel free to commit and push all you want.

- You could also use the [shell](https://happygitwithr.com/shell.html) to clone the repo or, alternatively, GitHub Desktop

- For beginners, using a Git GUI (like GitHub Desktop) and R-Studio will cover well over 90% of the use cases imo

See, e.g., [here](https://happygitwithr.com) for further reading.
